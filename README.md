## DBpedia-WarmUp-Task
This is for the Warm-up tasks proposed by DBPedia as part of GSoC 2018.
# Here is a list of the Warm-up tasks, that were designed to get familiar with the DBPedia workflow.
- [] Find 10 or 100 errors in DBPedia
- [] Run the extraction Framework
Next up, we have the tasks speciific to the GSoC project. These tasks are :
- [] Read the paper (SPARQL as a foreign language [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07624))
- [] Train a Neural SPARQL model Machine Model on a DBPedia class of your choice.
- [] Run the RVA-based embedding algorithm on a DBpedia subset (read [notebook](https://akshayjagatap.wordpress.com/)).
- [] Run the [evaluation of existing KB embedding methods](https://github.com/nausheenfatma/embeddings/tree/master/gsoc2017-nausheen).
# In the subsequent sections, I am going to explain the way in which these tasks were completed.
